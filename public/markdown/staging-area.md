# Staging area

The staging area is the place where your files go after you add them with `git add`. Think of it as a box: you can use it to pack files together. It is mainly used to help you structure your commits, as you can only add a part of the files you changed to make small and meaningful commits, instead of adding everything at once. You can check what's in the staging area using `git status`.
